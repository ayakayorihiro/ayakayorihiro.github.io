      <p>
        This is a little guide containing some advice on applying to graduate schools,
        based on the experiences I had in Fall 2019 - Spring 2020. I hope that this
        will serve as some words of wisdom, and also as some encouragement. While this was originally
        intended to target Swarthmore CS students, I thought it might be nice if it was
        available to more people in the case that others would like to see it.
        <b> Please read the disclaimers first!! </b>
        Also, please feel free to email me ()
      </p>
    <h2> Disclaimers and About Me </h2>
    <h3> Disclaimers </h3>
    <ol>
    <li> <b>EVERYONE</b>’s grad school application experiences are different. <b>Please
      take most things in this document with a grain of salt</b>, because this doc is
       based on my own experience. That being said, I will try my best to keep
      this doc as general as possible.
    </li>
    <li> Adding onto #1, <b>the expectations for grad school applications vary based
       on field, even sub-fields of CS. Also for MS vs PhD</b>. </li>
    <li> I only applied for CS PhD programs, so that’s what I will be talking about. </li>
    <li> I <b>do not</b> know what got me into grad school, so please don’t expect any
       info of the sort in this doc. As everyone says, <b>grad school applications
       are a crapshoot</b>. Sometimes a good one, sometimes a bad one. The goal of
      this doc is to feature things that I wish I knew when I was applying.
      (I have to admit that most of this is advice you can hear from your profs) </li>
    <li> This is a living document that I’ll be incrementally filling out.
      I’ll delete this disclaimer once I finish writing what needs to be said. (9/16) </li>
    </ol>

    Given the Disclaimers, I should probably explain a bit of my background…

    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <ol>
    <li> I am currently a first-year PhD student at Cornell University
      (as of fall 2020). At Swarthmore, I was a double major in Computer
      Science and Music.</li>
    <li> I applied in my senior fall, so the ideal target audience of this doc might
      be people who are thinking of doing the same thing. </li>
    <li> My area of interest is Programming Language theory and applications. </li>
    <li> I did PL research during my Junior spring, the summer between my Junior
      and Senior year, and all throughout my senior year.
    </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Considering Grad School? </h2>

    <h2> Applying to Grad School </h2>
    <h3> General Advice and Planning </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s totally OK not to know what you want to specifically work on by
        the time you apply, or even by the time you get into grad school!!
        I’m still not quite sure what I want to do specifically.
        <ul>
          <li>
            That being said, it’s always good to have a general idea (even
            though that might change!) and have some buzz words by your side
            when someone asks you what you are interested in.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        According to the wonderful Swat CS profs, <b>you should apply to
         9~12 schools</b>. I full heartedly agree, and here are a couple of notes on this…
         <ul>
           <li>I applied to 15 schools and it was definitely way too much.</li>
           <li>Yes, increasing the number of schools would increase your chances
              of achieving the big goal (refer to bottom of this section). </li>
            <li> BUT ask yourself, “is this extra school somewhere I’d definitely want to go if I was accepted?” </li>
            <li> Chances are that you’ll get accepted to one of the 9~12 schools
              you apply to :) If you want to apply for more schools, just make
              sure to acknowledge that adding another school means adding on
              the number of hours you have to work on apps!!</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Your research/academic advisor is an amazing and wonderful resource!
        Check in with them about the little decisions that you’re making
        (like, what schools you are applying to), and ask them for advice!!
        <b>Start talking to them early!</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ultimately, it probably doesn’t (and shouldn’t) matter when you submit
        your application, as long as you have it within the application submission deadline.
        <ul>
          <li> That being said, something that was helpful for me was to set
            an early deadline for submitting my first application. (Around
            the beginning of November... but in reality it didn't even need to
            be that early.)
          </li>
          <li>
            This was especially helpful for me because it meant that I needed to work
            on the core of my application (Personal Statement, CV, etc) before
            that date, and all I had left was filling in more school-specific
            things.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
