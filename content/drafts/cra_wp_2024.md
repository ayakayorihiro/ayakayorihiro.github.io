On April 11th to 13th, I attended [CRA-WP](https://cra.org/cra-wp/)'s
[Grad Cohort Workshop for
Women](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-for-women/), co-located with
the [Grad Cohort Workshop for IDEALS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity,
Accessibility, and Leadership
Skills)](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-ideals/). This was a great
opportunity to meet wonderful computing researchers in both academia
and industry.

If you are a grad student looking for opportunities to get grad school
advice and meet cool computing researchers (grad students, faculty,
industry researchers) outside of your sub-field of CS/IS/etc, this is
a great one! I hope this post encourages you to apply for the next
cycle :)

and an experienced one, and I wanted

couple of days. As much as I love all the nature in Ithaca and my
friends, I also . Also, it's often said that travelling for conferences is
one of the biggest perks of being an academic :)
