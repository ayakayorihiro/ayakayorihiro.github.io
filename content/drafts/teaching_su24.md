This past summer (2024), I taught a six-week course on Cornell's [Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming](https://courses.cis.cornell.edu/courses/cs2110/2024su/) class (CS2110). This post is to reflect on my summer and give readers a taste of how summer teaching may go!

**Disclaimer:** This post is more of a summary of thoughts and takeaways than a chronological recalling of events.

## Precursors

### Why did I decide to teach?

**TL;DR:** I love helping people learn CS and have been wanting to pursue a career focused on that, and this felt like the next step.

Over the course of my academic journey, I've been lucky to have the chance to help students learn computer science. My first experience was as a [Ninja](https://www.swarthmore.edu/computer-science/ninjas) (aka Student Mentor, which sounds less interesting) for Swarthmore's Intro CS class (CS21), where I hosted help sessions in the evenings. I remember absolutely loving the spark that went off the moment a student really grasped a concept they've been struggling with. As a student who also struggled with big-time impostor syndrome (which I still do sometimes as a fifth-year PhD student), it was immensely gratifying to see students build up their programming skills and gain confidence in their ability to do CS.

As a TA in grad school, I got the chance to lead discussion sections, where there was a mix of presenting new material and lab work where we helped students work on group activities. At first, I was really nervous about standing in front of students and being responsible for a part of the class. But as I went through it a couple of times, I got a bit more used to it, and I knew what to improve upon. Soon enough, discussion section became my favorite part of my work week.

These experiences made me want to go into teaching-focused careers such as a Professor at a Small Liberal Arts College (SLAC), or a Lecturer/Teaching faculty at a Research University. Instructing a summer class felt like the next step towards that goal for a couple of reasons: (1) I could actually get a taste of what teaching CS is like, and see whether this was actually a career path that I wanted to take; (2) I can assess whether I was "fit"/"good enough" for such a job, and concretely figure out what I can improve; and (3) having solo instructor experience is important when applying for such jobs (both for the CV and for forming your own opinions about teaching).

<!--
- I've been considering a teaching-focused job as a career path
  - TA-ing as a ugrad (SLAC): "office hours"/help sessions. Helped me realize I like helping ppl debug
  - TA-ing as a grad student: leading discussion sections/recitations
  - These experiences made me want to go into teaching-focused careers, and this felt like the next step

### Some luck-based advantages I had

I think I was set up to have a slightly easier experience than past summer grad student instructors for two reasons. First, I was a teaching assistant for CS2110 during the previous two semesters (FA23, SP24). On top of that, in FA23 I led grading sessions, and in SP24 I outlined future discussion sections during our weekly TA meeting, designed a couple of new discussion sections, and also designed some final exam questions. This meant that I was familiar with both the contents of CS2110 (and Java), but also the grading procedures, expectations, and discussions. Second, I ended up having only *ten* students. This small class size helped me feel like everything was managable and under control a lot of the time.

### What is CS2110? How is it different during the summer?

[CS2110](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SU24/class/CS/2110) is Cornell's Data Structures course, and often the second class students take after Intro to CS. Some unique topics in CS2110 are Loop Invariants, GUIs in Java (using Swing), and Concurrency.

The summer version of CS2110 is only six weeks long, compared to the 14+ weeks during the semester. Classes were held Monday-Friday for 1hr45min (more on this later). This meant that the class was very fast-paced - students had less time between classes and assignments. But, students usually only take up to two courses in the summer, so I heard that they enjoyed being able to focus on the class. This short-but-intensive summer period had similar pros and cons for me as the instructor. *Teaching during the summer was a LOT of work, but I'm really glad I had the chance to ONLY focus on teaching for a SHORT amount of time.*

### Special Thanks

My offering of CS2110 wouldn't have been possible (or as great) without the help of many people. Thank you all very much!!

- My TA [Youming Meng](https://denghilbert.github.io/)
- My mentors [Curran Muhlberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~curran/), [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/), [Zachary Palmer](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/), [Dietrich Geisler](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dgeisler/), [Alexa VanHattum](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~avh/) who all provided me extremely helpful advice
- My labmate [Kevin Negy](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kevinnegy/) who was also great company as a fellow summer instructor
- My students who gave me a chance to help them learn CS :)

## Challenges and Strategies

### Course/Lecture Prep

- Cutting corners is 100% the way to go
  - I definitely would've had a really hard time with analysis paralysis/just having too much on my hands if I didn't have all of the previous material
  - And that's ok bc it's my first time teaching. Cornell knows this, my mentors know this, the students know this

- The "extra time" problem
  - Was not really a problem after all lol
  - intermission!
  - Talking slower, giving more time for exercises and code demos

- My initial strategy was to simply copy existing slides and doing things (nearly) *exactly* how Curran did them.
  - especially for things that I wasn't 100% sure about, I watched and took notes on the panopto recordings from SP24
  - This was helpful because it gave me a sense of assurance that as long as I show the slides, I can't be messing up *too much*.
  - It also helped me focus on my speaking skills initially (enunciating, speaking slowly)
  - The first couple of weeks were really about *survival* (making sure the class actually ran) and getting a feel for how class can/should be run

### Class Observations

- In the 2nd and 3rd wks of class I had Dietrich, Adrian, Curran stop by lecture and see how I was doing
  - All of their feedback was very useful!

## What are my takeaways?

### Teaching is a lot of fun!

- So much fun!!!!!!!!!
  - Sth interesting is that I found different parts of it fun as I progressed
  - First I found that going up there and giving lecture was the most fun. The adrenaline rush is real
  - But later I started playing around with the lectures, and I started to find lecture prep more fun

### Personal Confidence Boost

- Got a lot of confidence not only for being an instructor, but as a person?
  - big accomplishment
  - Personally found it really gratifying that students understood what I was teaching
  - takeaway: it's ok to make mistakes
  - improv exercise

### Time to take a nap

- That being said I was so tired by the end of it that I had to roll around for a week doing nothing
  - Also was very tired in the middle, so I had to learn to spend less prep time/personal time
