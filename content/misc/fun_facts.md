- Outside CS, I am a big fan of many things: dogs, the viola, singing,
               board games, baking, memes, the J-POP band [Official
               HIGE DANdism]("https://higedan.com/"), and more!
               Recently, I've been listening to the brilliant artist [Ado](
               "https://www.universal-music.co.jp/ado/") and reading
               mystery novels by [Keigo
               Higashino]("https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/117366.Keigo_Higashino")
               and [Miyuki
               Miyabe]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyuki_Miyabe").
- My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
  a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
  improvisatory *Fantasie* and *Potpourri* musical genres.
               You can read it [here]("/files/music_senior_comp.pdf").
- A performance that I did with some very cool people was featured in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnkqcm0uvWE) on Swarthmore's youtube channel!
  - The full first movement is featured [here](https://www.swarthmore.edu/living-liberal-arts/fetter-chamber-music-concert), accompanied by a rare publically available picture of me playing a musical instrument.
- I have perfect pitch! This means that I can identify musical notes without any references.
- I was on the Varsity Tennis team for all four years of high school, and somehow this surprised all of my friends in college.
- If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!
