      <p>
        <!-- Bio! --> I am a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href =
                                                              "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/"> Department of Computer
          Science</a> at <a href = "https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell
          University</a> working with <a href = "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a>. I
        received a BA in Computer Science and Music from
        <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a> in May 2020,
        where I was advised by <a href = "https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/">
          Zachary Palmer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am generally interested in Programming Languages and
        Software Engineering. My research explores ways to help
        programmers better understand and find bugs in their code. At
        Swarthmore, I worked on developing the theory and
        implementation of <i>Plume</i>, a family of static program
        analyses for functional programs that supports not only
        fixed-size list-based context models, but also
        a <i>Set-based</i> context model, where control flows are
        equated with the same set of call sites on the program stack.
        From experimentation on both types of context models in
        various program analyses, we found that the set-based model
        shows promise for tractability and expressivity on
        representative functional programs for both forward- and
        demand-driven functional analyses.

      <p>My first name can be pronounced like either "eye-AH-ka" or
               "AH-ya-ka", and a nice work-around in pronouncing my
               last name is to say "You're a hero" fast.

             <li> My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
               a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
               improvisatory <i>Fantasie</i> and <i>Potpourri</i> musical genres.
               You can read it <a href = "music_senior_comp.pdf">here</a>.

             <li> I was on the Varsity Tennis team for all four years of my High School
               career, and somehow this surprised all of my friends in college.</li>
             <li> I am one of those people who have perfect pitch, and
             will tell you that I have perfect pitch whenever I get a
             chance to do so. </li>
             <li> If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element
               of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!
