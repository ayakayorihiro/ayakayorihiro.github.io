I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) working with [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [Capra research group](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/). I received a BA in [Computer Science](https://www.swarthmore.edu/computer-science) and [Music](https://www.swarthmore.edu/music) from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/) in May 2020, where I was advised by [Zachary Palmer](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/).

I am generally interested in Programming Languages and Software Engineering. More specifically, my research explores ways to help programmers better understand and find bugs in their code. At Swarthmore, I studied context model designs and their effects on static higher-order program analyses. Some of my time at Cornell was spent tackling challenges in Runtime Verification, a dynamic analysis technique to check program executions against formally specified properties. These days, I'm working on tools for hardware development that take inspiration from software engineering.
<!--- # A tidbit about Plume. Maybe I can resurrect this later -->
<!--- Plume's novelty comes from supporting a Set-based context model, where control flows are equated with the same set of call sites on the program stack. We found in our experiments that the set-based model shows promise for tractability and expressivity on representative functional programs for both forward- and demand-driven functional analyses. -->

**Pronounciation Guide:** My first name can be pronounced as either "eye-AH-ka" (most common) or "AH-ya-ka" (closer to the Japanese intonation). A nice work-around in pronouncing my last name is to say "You're a hero" fast.
