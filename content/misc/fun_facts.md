- Outside CS, I like to play the viola, play tennis, sing, and bake! I am also a big fan of dogs. I enjoy listening to 
               [Official HIGE DANdism](https://higedan.com/), 
                [Ado](
               https://www.universal-music.co.jp/ado/), and [NOMELON NOLEMON](https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/PR/NOMELONNOLEMON/).  I am currently reading [Newcomer by Keigo
               Higashino](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33602102-newcomer).	       
- I am a member of the wonderful [Ithaca Community Orchestra](https://www.ithacacommunityorchestra.org/)
  where I've played the viola, the triangle, the güiro, and tom-toms!
- My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
  a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
  improvisatory *Fantasie* and *Potpourri* musical genres.
               You can read it [here](/files/music_senior_comp.pdf).
- A performance that I did with some amazing people was featured in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnkqcm0uvWE) on Swarthmore's youtube channel!
  - The full first movement is featured [here](https://www.swarthmore.edu/living-liberal-arts/fetter-chamber-music-concert), accompanied by a rare publically available picture of me playing a musical instrument.
- I have perfect pitch! This means that I can identify musical notes without any references.
- If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!
