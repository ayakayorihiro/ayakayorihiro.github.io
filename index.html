    <h2> About </h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Bio! --> I am a second-year PhD student in the <a href =
      "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/"> Department of Computer
      Science</a> at <a href = "https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell
      University</a> working with <a href =
      "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~legunsen/">Owolabi Legunsen</a>. I
      received a BA in Computer Science and Music from
      <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a> in May 2020,
      where I was advised by <a href = "https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/">
      Zachary Palmer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am generally interested in Software Engineering and Programming Languages, with the goal
      to explore various
      avenues to help programmers and engineers better understand code and find bugs.
      <!-- Some things in Computer Science that fascinate me are -->
      <!-- Programming Languages, Automata Theory, and -->
      <!-- the idea of Undecidability.  -->
      At Swarthmore, I worked on developing the
      theory and implementation of <i>Plume</i>, a family of static program analyses
      for functional programs that supports not only fixed-size list-based context models,
      but also a <i>Set-based</i> context model, where control flows are equated with
      the same set of call sites on the program stack. From experimentation on both
      types of context models in various program analyses,
      we found that the set-based model shows promise for tractability and
      expressivity on representative functional programs for both forward- and demand-driven
      functional analyses.
    </p>
    <h2> Research </h2>
    <h3> Projects </h3>
    <p>
      Currently, I am exploring various topics in Runtime Verification. More info coming soon!
    </p>
    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   On the side, I am exploring <i>Linear Conjunctive Languages</i> and their -->
    <!--   applications to Program Analyses. As a language class, the Linear -->
    <!--   Conjunctive Languages are incomparable to the Context Free Languages. -->
    <!--   Their significance lies in that they recognize languages such as the interleaving -->
    <!--   of <i>Dyck Languages</i> (the language of matched parentheses), allowing the program -->
    <!--   analysis problem of tracking control and data flow -->
    <!--   to be mapped onto a -->
    <!--   LCL reachability problem. While this implies that LCL reachability is -->
    <!--   undecidable, LCL reachability approximation algorithms allow for a new approach for -->
    <!--   creating more precise Program Analyses. -->

      <li>I co-organized Cornell CS's <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/phdvisit/">2021 Admitted Students Day</a>! </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Misc </h2>
    <h3> Fun Facts </h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Outside CS, I am a big fan of many things: dogs, the viola,
      board games, baking, memes, the J-POP band <a href = "https://higedan.com/">
      Official HIGE DANdism</a>,
      wonderful comedy shows
      <a href = "https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place">The Good Place</a>
      and <a href = "https://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>,
       and more!
      </li>
    <li> My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
      a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
      improvisatory <i> Fantasie </i> and <i> Potpourri </i> musical genres.
      You can read it <a href = "music_senior_comp.pdf">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li> I was on the Varsity Tennis team for all four years of my High School
      career, and somehow this surprised all of my friends in College.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who have perfect pitch, and will tell you that I have perfect pitch whenever I get a chance to do so. </li>
    <li> My first name can be pronounced like either "eye-AH-ka" or "AH-ya-ka", and a nice
    work-around in pronouncing my last name is to say "You're a hero" fast. </li>
    <li> If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element
      of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Musings and Advice </h3>
    <p>Not quite sure what this section is, but I wrote some things down that
    may or may not be helpful...

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "posts/grad_school_app_advice.html"> Advice on applying to graduate
          programs.<a> I tried to make this as general as possible, but basically it's
          a compilation of things that I learned from my own application process.
