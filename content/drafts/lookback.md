[Look Back](https://gkids.com/films/look-back/) is a beautiful coming-of-age movie about two girls who share a passion in drawing. The movie is based on the critically acclaimed one-shot manga written by [Tatsuki Fujimoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuki_Fujimoto) in 2021. This 58-minute short movie somehow moved me so much that I (someone who doesn't watch movies too often) went back to theaters a second time to bawl my eyes out, and am writing a blog post about it now. I believe the movie speaks to artists, creators, or maybe anyone who's been passionate or ambitious, and helps them *look back* upon their motivations, joys, and pains of passion.

**Note: This post contains mild spoilers about the movie Look Back [[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6HOnlTnVwc)]. The film is out of theaters in the US but not on streaming yet, so if it sounds interesting I'd suggest reading the original manga or waiting a couple of months.**

### Brief synopsis (mild spoilers)

The story centers around Fujino, an outgoing girl who is praised for the comic strips she draws for her elementary school class newsletter. One day, her teacher asks if she can share the comic strip space on the newsletter with Kyomoto, a shut-in girl who doesn't come to school. While Fujino snarkily accepts sharing the space with Kyomoto, thinking that a shut-in can't be any better than her, she quickly finds out that Kyomoto's art is exceptionally better than hers. Frustrated by this, Fujino immerses herself into improving her art. Years later, Fujino realizes she cannot reach Kyomoto's level despite her efforts, and quits drawing.

On graduation day, Fujino meets Kyomoto, who reveals herself as Fujino's biggest fan. Fujino's passion for drawing is reignited and the two team up to be a strong manga duo.

Many years pass and an adult Fujino regrets drawing. But, Fujino revisits her shared passion with Kyomoto and returns to draw manga.

### Thoughts

The story of this 58-minute movie seems so simple when writing out or reading a synopsis, but I think its subtleties are what makes it special.

A thing that struck me was the realization that Fujino *isn't the best person*. You find that a lot of her motivations
