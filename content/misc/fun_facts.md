               and [Miyuki
               Miyabe]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyuki_Miyabe").

- I was on the Varsity Tennis team for all four years of high school, and somehow this surprised all of my friends in college.
- I am one of those people who have perfect pitch, and will tell you that I have perfect pitch whenever I get a chance to do so.
- If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!
