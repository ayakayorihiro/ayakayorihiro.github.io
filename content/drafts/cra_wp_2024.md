On April 11th to 13th, I attended [CRA-WP](https://cra.org/cra-wp/)'s
[Grad Cohort Workshop for
Women](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-for-women/), co-located with
the [Grad Cohort Workshop for IDEALS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity,
Accessibility, and Leadership
Skills)](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-ideals/). This was a great
opportunity to meet wonderful computing researchers in both academia
and industry.

If you are a grad student looking for opportunities to meet cool
computing researchers (grad students, faculty, industry researchers)
outside of your sub-field of CS/IS/etc, this is a great one! I hope
this post encourages you to apply for the next cycle :)

## What is CRA-WP?

## Why did I attend?

- Heard about this from a wonderful mentor
- Gain advice for being a somewhat new, but older student
- Meet new people and gain perspectives!
- It also helps to leave the Ithaca bubble for a bit.

## What was it like?

- Surprsingly a mix of both early PhD and late PhD (I really thought everyone there was gonna be a 1st yr)
- Lots of people outside my fields
- Talks were helpful in remembering some meta-principles
- 1-1 interactions were the most fun part
- Poster presentations
