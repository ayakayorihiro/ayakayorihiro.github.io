    <h2> About </h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Bio! -->
      I am a first-year PhD student in the <a href = "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">
      Department of Computer Science</a>
      at <a href = "https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>.
      I received a BA in Computer Science and Music from
      <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a> in May 2020,
      where I was advised by <a href = "https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/">
      Zachary Palmer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things in Computer Science that fascinate me are
      Programming Languages, Automata Theory, and
      the idea of Undecidability. At Swarthmore, I worked on developing the
      theory and implementation of <i>Plume</i>, a family of program analyses
      for functional programs that supports not only fixed-size list-based context models,
      but also a <i>Set-based</i> context model, where control flows are equated with
      the same set of call sites on the program stack. From experimentation on both
      types of context models in various program analyses,
      we found that the set-based model is tractable and
      expressive on representative functional programs for both forward- and demand-driven
      functional analyses.

    <h3> Projects </h3>
    <p>
      <!-- Projects -->
      I am currently exploring <i>Linear Conjunctive Languages</i> and their
      applications to Program Analyses. <!-- They can be expressed in grammar form,
      or the equivalent Triangular Trellis Automata. --> As a language class, the Linear
      Conjunctive Languages are incomparable to Context Free Languages.
      Their significance lies in that they recognize languages such as the interleaving
      of <i>Dyck Languages</i> (the language of matched parentheses).
      This implies that the program analysis problem of tracking control and data flow
      to be mapped onto a
      LCL reachability problem. While this implies that LCL reachability is
      undecidable, LCL reachability approximation algorithms allow for a new approach for
      creating more precise Program Analyses.

    <h2> Misc </h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Outside CS, I am a big fan of many things: dogs, the viola,
      board games, baking, memes, the J-POP band <a href = "https://higedan.com/">
      Official HIGE DANdism</a>,
      wonderful comedy shows
      <a href = "https://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>
      and <a href = "https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place">The Good Place</a>,
       and more!
      </li>
    <li> My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
      a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
      improvisatory <i> Fantasie </i> and <i> Potpourri </i> musical genres.
      You can read it <a href = "music_senior_comp.pdf">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li> I was on the Varsity Tennis team for all four years of my High School
      career, and somehow this surprised all of my friends in College.</li>
    <li> My first name can be pronounced like either "eye-AH-ka" or "A-ya-ka", and a nice
    work-around in pronouncing my last name is to say "You're a hero" fast. </li>
    <li> If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element
      of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!
