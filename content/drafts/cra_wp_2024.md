On April 11-13th, I attended [CRA-WP](https://cra.org/cra-wp/)'s [Grad
Cohort Workshop for
Women](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-for-women/), co-located with
the [Grad Cohort Workshop for IDEALS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity,
Accessibility, and Leadership
Skills)](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-ideals/). This was a great
opportunity to meet wonderful computing researchers in both academia
and industry. Most importantly, this is a chance to talk with
researchers *outside* your graduate program about *meta*-grad-school
topics, such as soft skills. (Usually when you meet researchers
outside of your program, it's at a technical conference, and you talk
about cool research)

If you are a grad student looking for opportunities to get grad school
advice and meet cool computing researchers (grad students, faculty,
industry researchers) outside of your sub-field of CS/IS/etc, this is
a great one! I hope this post encourages you to apply for the next
cycle :)

## What is the CRA-WP Grad Cohort for Women?

The [CRA-WP](https://cra.org/cra-wp/) is a committee within the CRA
(Computing Research Association) that aims to increase participation
in computing research from underrepresented populations in computing.
You can read more about their goals
[here](https://cra.org/cra-wp/mission/).

The Grad Cohort for Women is a 2-3 day workshop that focuses on grad
school survival skills, especially how to navigate difficult spaces as
a woman in CS. There are panel talks, where researchers share their
experiences and perspectives on publishing papers, work-life balance,
navigating difficult interactions, figuring out career paths,
internship search, prepping your candidacy exam, and many more. There
are also 1-1 short advising sessions where you can meet with senior
researchers to ask for general advice, or have them take a look at
your Resume/CV. And of course, there are also plenty of opportunities
for informal discussions through lunches/dinners/other social events.
Both researchers in academia and industry attend, so that you can gain
perspectives from both ends of the spectrum.

## Why did I apply/attend?

I first heard about the workshop from Professor [Vasanta
Chaganti](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/), one of my
wonderful mentors at Swarthmore. Last summer, as I was going through
an especially tough time in my PhD, Vasanta recommended me to join
groups such as the CRA-WP. She emphasized the importance of having a
strong academic support system, and getting advice from many different
people. This point was very compelling to me.

A couple of months after hearing about CRA-WP, I ended up making a
large turn in my academic life. I already felt that attending the
workshop and getting advice would be really helpful... But this big
change made it seem like I had *even more* of a need to gain wisdom
from senior researchers and expand my support group.

Lastly, I thought it'll be good to leave the Ithaca bubble for a
couple of days. As much as I love all the nature in Ithaca and my
friends, I haven't travelled long distance in a long while. Also, it's
often said that travelling for conferences is one of the biggest perks
of being an academic :)

## What was it like?


As an aside, LinkedIn's (maybe new) QR-code functionality made it *extremely* easy to connect with people :)


- Surprsingly a mix of both early PhD and late PhD (I really thought everyone there was gonna be a 1st yr)
- People at this conference are really nice.
- Lots of people outside my fields
- Talks were helpful in remembering some meta-principles about grad school
- 1-1 interactions were the most fun part
- Poster presentations
- Favorite session was the storytelling one

## Takeaways

0. It's nice to have a space where you can be more vulnerable with people.
1. Sharing experiences is empowering
2. Making new friends is fun!
