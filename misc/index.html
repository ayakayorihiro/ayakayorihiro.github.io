<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Outside CS, I like to play the viola, play tennis, sing, and bake! I am also a big fan of dogs. I enjoy listening to 
<a href="https://higedan.com/">Official HIGE DANdism</a>, 
<a href="https://www.universal-music.co.jp/ado/">Ado</a>, and <a href="https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/PR/NOMELONNOLEMON/">NOMELON NOLEMON</a>.  I am currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33602102-newcomer">Newcomer by Keigo
Higashino</a>.</li>
<li>I am a member of the wonderful <a href="https://www.ithacacommunityorchestra.org/">Ithaca Community Orchestra</a>
where I've played the viola, the triangle, the güiro, and tom-toms!</li>
<li>My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
improvisatory <em>Fantasie</em> and <em>Potpourri</em> musical genres.
You can read it <a href="/files/music_senior_comp.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>A performance that I did with some amazing people was featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnkqcm0uvWE">video</a> on Swarthmore's youtube channel!
<ul>
<li>The full first movement is featured <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/living-liberal-arts/fetter-chamber-music-concert">here</a>, accompanied by a rare publically available picture of me playing a musical instrument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have perfect pitch! This means that I can identify musical notes without any references.</li>
<li>If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!</li>
</ul>
