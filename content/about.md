# About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) working with Adrian Sampson. I received a BA in Computer Science and Music from Swarthmore College in May 2020, where I was advised by Zachary Palmer.

I am generally interested in Programming Languages and Software Engineering. My research explores ways to help programmers better understand and find bugs in their code. At Swarthmore, I worked on developing the theory and implementation of Plume, a family of static program analyses for functional programs that supports not only fixed-size list-based context models, but also a Set-based context model, where control flows are equated with the same set of call sites on the program stack. From experimentation on both types of context models in various program analyses, we found that the set-based model shows promise for tractability and expressivity on representative functional programs for both forward- and demand-driven functional analyses.

My first name can be pronounced as either "eye-AH-ka" or "AH-ya-ka", and a nice work-around in pronouncing my last name is to say "You're a hero" fast.
