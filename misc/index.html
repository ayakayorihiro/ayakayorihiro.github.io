<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Outside CS, I am a big fan of many things: dogs and cats, the viola,
singing, J-POP, board games, baking, memes, and more!
Specifically, I enjoy listening to the wonderful band
<a href="https://higedan.com/">Official HIGE DANdism</a> and the
brilliant singer <a href="https://www.universal-music.co.jp/ado/">Ado</a>. These days,
I'm reading mystery novels by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/117366.Keigo_Higashino">Keigo
Higashino</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyuki_Miyabe">Miyuki
Miyabe</a>.</li>
<li>My undergrad thesis in Music was written about Johann Nepomuk Hummel,
a composer contemporary of Beethoven, and his role in cultivating the
improvisatory <em>Fantasie</em> and <em>Potpourri</em> musical genres.
You can read it <a href="/files/music_senior_comp.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>A performance that I did with some very cool people was featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnkqcm0uvWE">video</a> on Swarthmore's youtube channel!
<ul>
<li>The full first movement is featured <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/living-liberal-arts/fetter-chamber-music-concert">here</a>, accompanied by a rare publically available picture of me playing a musical instrument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have perfect pitch! This means that I can identify musical notes without any references.</li>
<li>I was on the Varsity Tennis team for all four years of high school, and somehow this surprised all of my friends in college.</li>
<li>If you take the first letter off of my last name, it becomes an element of a nonregular language - the language of palindromes!</li>
</ul>
